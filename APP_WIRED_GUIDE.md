## 🎨 Customization

### Change Hero State

Edit `/screens/HomeScreen.tsx` line 47:

```tsx
// Change from "new" to see different states
const [gameState] = useState<"new" | "active" | "completed">("new");

// Try these:
"new"       → Shows "Start Daily Challenge"
"active"    → Shows "Resume Game" with preview
"completed" → Shows "View Results" with share
```

### Change Tab Colors

Edit `/components/TopTabs.tsx` or `/app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`:

```tsx
tabBarActiveTintColor: "#16A349"; // Your brand color
```

### Change Mock Data

All data comes from `/mocks.ts`:

```tsx
export const mockProfile = {
    username: "YourName", // Change this!
    totalGames: 100, // And this!
    // ... etc
};
```

## 📁 New File Structure

```
TweetRush/
├── navigation/
│   ├── AppNavigator.tsx   ← Main navigator with 5 tabs
│   └── index.ts
├── components/
│   └── TopTabs.tsx        ← Custom tab bar
├── screens/
│   ├── HomeScreen.tsx     ← Redesigned with hero cards
│   ├── PlayScreen.tsx     ← Game wrapper
│   ├── BountiesScreen.tsx
│   ├── LeaderboardScreen.tsx
│   └── ProfileScreen.tsx
└── app/(tabs)/
    ├── index.tsx          ← Loads AppNavigator
    └── _layout.tsx        ← Styled bottom tabs
```

## 🎯 Navigation Flow

```
App Start
   ↓
AppNavigator (Top Tabs)
   ↓
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Home │ Play │ Bounties │ ... │   ← Top Tabs
└─────────────────────────────────┘
   ↓
Current Screen (based on active tab)
```

### How It Works:

1. `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` renders `AppNavigator`
2. `AppNavigator` manages which tab is active
3. `TopTabs` shows the tab bar and handles tab switching
4. Current screen renders based on active tab

## 🔄 Tab Switching

Tap any tab → Screen smoothly transitions with fade animation.

All tabs are **always available** - no need to navigate back, just tap the tab you want!

## 🎮 Try These Interactions

1. **Home → Play Tab**

    - Tap "Start Daily Challenge" on Home
    - Auto-switches to Play tab
    - See full game with keyboard

2. **Test Game Flow**

    - On Play tab, tap "Test Win"
    - See victory modal with bounty
    - Tap "Continue"
    - Still in Play tab

3. **Browse All Tabs**

    - Tap through all 5 tabs
    - Each has full UI ready
    - Everything is interactive!

4. **Use Shortcuts**
    - On Home, tap any shortcut button
    - Navigates to that section
    - Tab bar updates

## 🚧 Mock Features

These work visually but aren't connected to backend:

-   ❌ Wallet connection (disabled button)
-   ❌ Bounty claiming (mock tooltip)
-   ❌ Word validation (shows alert)
-   ❌ Real game logic (UI only)

**Everything is clearly marked with "Mock:" labels**

## 🎨 Design Notes

### Hero Card States

The home screen hero card has **3 visual states**:

**State 1: New Game** (`gameState = "new"`)

-   Shows empty grid preview
-   "Start Daily Challenge" button (primary)
-   "Play Quick Game" button (secondary)

**State 2: Active Game** (`gameState = "active"`)

-   Shows 2 filled rows from mock data
-   "Resume Game" button
-   Attempts counter (2/6)
-   Bounty chip if active

**State 3: Completed** (`gameState = "completed"`)

-   Victory emoji 🎉
-   "Solved in 4 attempts"
-   "View Results" button
-   "Share" button

### Tab Behavior

-   **Active tab**: Primary green background
-   **Inactive tabs**: Gray background
-   **Smooth transitions**: Cross-fade + slide
-   **Haptic feedback**: On tab press (built-in)
