# TweetRush

## The Vision
TweetRush makes blockchain accessible through a fun, mobile-first word game that rewards players with real crypto. It's Wordle meets Play-to-Earn.

## What is TweetRush?
A simple 5-letter word puzzle game where players guess daily words and earn cryptocurrency rewards from shared bounty pools. Built for Web2 and Web3 users alike.

## Key Features
* Wordle-style gameplay - 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word
* On-chain rewards - Win a share of daily bounty pools
* Streaks & leaderboards - Build multipliers and climb rankings
* Mobile-first - React Native for seamless experience
* Easy entry - No crypto experience needed

## The Problem
Millions are curious about blockchain but find it too complex. Meanwhile, casual gaming is massive ($35% of app revenue), but crypto games feel complicated.

Africa especially lacks easy on-ramps to blockchain technology.

## The Opportunity
* Casual mobile gaming dominates the app economy
* Crypto gaming projected to hit $65B+ by 2028
* Africa is a crypto innovation hotbed
* Wordle proved massive demand for simple, viral games

Perfect timing to bridge Web2 gamers with Web3 rewards.

## How It Works
1. Play - Guess a 5-letter word daily (6 tries)
2. Win - Solve the puzzle and claim your share of the bounty pool
3. Earn - Stack rewards and climb the leaderboard
4. Repeat - Build streaks for bonus multipliers

## Revenue Streams
* Sponsor bounties - DAOs and brands fund daily word bounties
* NFT collectibles - Mint achievements, streaks, and badges
* Brand partnerships - "Sponsored words" and tournaments
* Premium features - Streak multipliers and perks

## Roadmap

| Phase | Focus |
|-------|-------|
| Phase 1 | UI & game flow (React Native) |
| Phase 2 | Blockchain integration (Stacks/CoreDAO) + wallet connect |
| Phase 3 | Public beta + bounty partnerships |
| Phase 4 | NFT streaks + analytics |
| Phase 5 | DAO-driven global events |

## What We're Looking For
* Seed funding to accelerate development
* Strategic partnerships with DAOs and gaming communities
* Early adopters to build our community
