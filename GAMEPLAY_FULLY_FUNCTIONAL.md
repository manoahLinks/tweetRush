# TweetRush - Fully Functional On-Chain Gameplay

## ✅ Gameplay is Now 100% Functional

All gameplay is now powered by real blockchain data with NO mock/dummy data!

## 🎮 Complete Gameplay Flow

### 1. Starting a Game

```
User taps "Start New Game" on PlayScreen
  ↓
Transaction: start-game()
  ↓
Blockchain:
  - Picks random word from pool
  - Creates active game record
  - Returns {game-id, word-index}
  ↓
GameContext loads active game
  ↓
GameScreen displays with empty 6x5 grid
  ↓
Ready to play!
```

**What you see:**
- Empty grid (6 rows × 5 columns)
- Keyboard enabled
- "0/6 attempts" counter
- Bounty indicator (if word has bounty)

### 2. Submitting Guesses

```
User types 5-letter word using keyboard
  ↓
Presses ENTER
  ↓
Validation: 
  - Must be exactly 5 letters ✓
  - Must have active game ✓
  - Must have attempts left ✓
  ↓
Optimistic Update:
  - Shows letters as "filled" tiles immediately
  - Provides instant feedback
  ↓
Transaction: submit-guess(word)
  ↓
Blockchain Processing (~4 seconds):
  - Validates guess
  - Evaluates against answer
  - Updates game state
  - Returns {result, won, attempts, game-complete, answer?}
  ↓
Game State Refresh:
  - Fetches updated game from blockchain
  - Updates grid with new guess
  - Shows guesses as "filled" state
  ↓
If game complete:
  - Fetches actual word using get-word-at-index()
  - Evaluates all guesses with answer
  - Shows proper tile colors (green/yellow/gray)
  - Displays win/lose modal
```

**During Active Play:**
- Guesses show as **filled tiles** (letters visible, no colors)
- This maintains suspense!
- Colors revealed when game completes

**When Game Completes:**
- All tiles evaluate and show colors
- Win modal or lose modal appears
- Target word is revealed
- Bounty auto-claimed if available

### 3. Tile Color System

| Color | Meaning | Contract Value |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 🟩 Green (correct) | Letter in correct position | 2 |
| 🟨 Yellow (present) | Letter in word, wrong position | 1 |
| ⬜ Gray (absent) | Letter not in word | 0 |
| 🔲 Filled | Submitted but not evaluated yet | - |

**Color Display:**
- **Active game**: All past guesses show as "filled" (gray)
- **Complete game**: All guesses evaluate and show proper colors
- **Current typing**: Shows letters as you type

### 4. Win/Lose Flow

#### Winning
```
Submit correct guess
  ↓
Transaction confirms
  ↓
Game state updates: won = true
  ↓
Fetch word using get-word-at-index()
  ↓
Evaluate all guesses with answer
  ↓
Grid shows all tile colors
  ↓
Win Modal displays:
  - "🎉 Victory!"
  - Target word revealed
  - Bounty claim button (if available)
  ↓
Stats auto-update on blockchain:
  - total-games++
  - games-won++
  - current-streak++
  - max-streak (if new record)
  ↓
Active game cleared
  ↓
Can start new game
```

#### Losing
```
Submit 6th incorrect guess
  ↓
Transaction confirms
  ↓
Game state updates: attempts = 6
  ↓
Fetch word using get-word-at-index()
  ↓
Evaluate all guesses with answer
  ↓
Grid shows all tile colors
  ↓
Lose Modal displays:
  - "Game Over"
  - Target word revealed
  ↓
Stats auto-update on blockchain:
  - total-games++
  - current-streak = 0 (reset)
  ↓
Active game cleared
  ↓
Can start new game
```

## 🔄 Game State Management

### Data Sources

1. **Blockchain (Source of Truth)**
   - Active game data
   - Guesses list
   - Attempts count
   - Won/lost status
   - Word pool

2. **Local Storage (Helper)**
   - Guess evaluations (for faster display)
   - Cleared when game completes

3. **Cache (Performance)**
   - 5-30 second TTL based on data type
   - Auto-invalidated after transactions

### State Flow

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Blockchain State (Authoritative)│
│  - active-games map             │
│  - player-stats map             │
│  - word-pool map                │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ (fetch)
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  GameContext (React State)      │
│  - gameState                    │
│  - isLoading                    │
│  - error                        │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
           ↓ (render)
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  GameScreen (UI)                │
│  - Grid display                 │
│  - Keyboard input               │
│  - Modals                       │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎲 Game Mechanics

### Evaluation Algorithm

The contract uses this logic (implemented in GameContext too):

```typescript
// 1. First pass: Mark exact matches (green)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (guess[i] === answer[i]) {
        result[i] = 2; // correct position
        mark answer[i] as used
    }
}

// 2. Second pass: Mark letter exists but wrong position (yellow)
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (result[i] === 2) continue; // already correct
    
    for (let j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
        if (!used[j] && guess[i] === answer[j]) {
            result[i] = 1; // wrong position
            mark answer[j] as used
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (not found) {
        result[i] = 0; // not in word
    }
}
```

**Example:**
- Answer: "STACK"
- Guess: "STALE"
- Result: [2, 2, 2, 0, 0]
  - S = correct (green)
  - T = correct (green)
  - A = correct (green)
  - L = absent (gray)
  - E = absent (gray)

### Attempts System

- **Max Attempts**: 6
- **Current Attempt**: Tracks which row to fill
- **Attempts Left**: 6 - current_attempt
- **Game Ends When**: Won OR attempts >= 6

## 📊 What's On-Chain vs Off-Chain

### Stored On-Chain ✅
- User registration (username)
- Active game state (word-index, attempts, guesses, won)
- Game history (past games)
- Player stats (total games, wins, streaks, average)
- Word pool (all words)
- Bounty pools (amounts, winners, claims)

### Stored Locally 📱
- Wallet mnemonic (encrypted)
- User onboarding status
- Guess evaluations (temporary, for faster display)
- UI preferences

### Cached (Performance) ⚡
- Read-only contract calls
- 5-30 second TTL
- Auto-invalidated after writes

## 🔍 Gameplay Example

### Complete Game Walkthrough

**Initial State:**
```
Word Pool: ["STACK", "CHAIN", "BLOCK", "TOKEN", "WRITE"]
User: Alice
Balance: 1.5 STX
```

**Turn 1:**
```
Alice types: STONE
Presses ENTER
  → Transaction sent
  → Grid shows: S T O N E (filled tiles)
  → Wait 4 seconds
  → Game still active
  → Tiles remain filled (no colors yet)
```

**Turn 2:**
```
Alice types: STACK
Presses ENTER
  → Transaction sent
  → Grid shows: S T A C K (filled tiles)
  → Wait 4 seconds
  → Game complete! won = true
  → Fetch answer: "STACK"
  → Evaluate all guesses:
      Turn 1: S=2, T=2, O=0, N=0, E=0
      Turn 2: S=2, T=2, A=2, C=2, K=2
  → Grid updates with colors
  → Win modal appears!
```

**Result:**
```
Stats Updated:
  - total-games: 0 → 1
  - games-won: 0 → 1
  - current-streak: 0 → 1
  - average-attempts: 2
  
Active game cleared
Can start new game immediately
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### GameContext Features

**State Management:**
```typescript
{
  gameState: {
    wordIndex: number,      // From blockchain
    targetWord: string,     // Fetched when complete
    attempts: number,       // From blockchain
    grid: GameTile[][],    // Reconstructed from guesses
    gameStatus: string,    // Derived from blockchain
    hasBounty: boolean,    // Fetched from bounty map
    bountyAmount: number   // From bounty map
  },
  isLoading: boolean,
  error: string | null
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `startGame()` → Calls blockchain, waits, loads state
- `submitGuess(word)` → Optimistic update, call blockchain, refresh
- `forfeitGame()` → Calls blockchain, clears state
- `refreshGameState()` → Refetches from blockchain

### Evaluation Logic

**Local Evaluation** (when answer known):
```typescript
evaluateGuess(guess, answer) {
  // Matches contract logic exactly
  // Returns [2,1,0,2,1] format
  // Used when game is complete
}
```

**Contract Evaluation** (read-only):
```clarity
evaluate-guess(guess answer) → (list 5 uint)
// Can be used for preview (not currently implemented)
```

### Word Fetching

When game completes:
```typescript
const wordData = await getWordAtIndex(wordIndex);
const answer = wordData.value; // e.g., "STACK"
```

Then evaluate all guesses:
```typescript
guesses.forEach(guess => {
  const evaluation = evaluateGuess(guess, answer);
  // Update tiles with colors
});
```
