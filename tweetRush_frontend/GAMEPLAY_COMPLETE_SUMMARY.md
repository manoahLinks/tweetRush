# ✅ Gameplay Integration Complete - Ready to Test!

## What I've Done

### 1. **Complete GameContext Rewrite**

-   ✅ Proper blockchain data parsing
-   ✅ Real guess evaluation logic (matches contract)
-   ✅ Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
-   ✅ Comprehensive error handling
-   ✅ Detailed logging throughout

### 2. **PlayScreen Integration**

-   ✅ Checks for active game from blockchain
-   ✅ Shows "Start New Game" if no game
-   ✅ Transitions to GameScreen when game exists
-   ✅ Beautiful UI with instructions

### 3. **GameScreen Fully Functional**

-   ✅ Displays real blockchain game state
-   ✅ Submits guesses with on-chain transactions
-   ✅ Shows letters immediately (optimistic)
-   ✅ Fetches answer when game completes
-   ✅ Evaluates and shows tile colors
-   ✅ Win/lose modals with real data

### 4. **Comprehensive Logging**

-   ✅ Every function call logged
-   ✅ All parameters logged
-   ✅ All responses logged
-   ✅ Errors logged with context
-   ✅ Cache hits/misses logged

### 5. **Contract Functions**

All contract functions properly integrated:

-   ✅ `start-game()` - Start new game
-   ✅ `submit-guess(word)` - Submit guess
-   ✅ `forfeit-game()` - Forfeit
-   ✅ `get-active-game(address)` - Load game
-   ✅ `has-active-game(address)` - Check game
-   ✅ `get-word-at-index(index)` - Get answer
-   ✅ `get-bounty(index)` - Check bounty
-   ✅ `get-player-stats(address)` - Load stats

## 🎮 How to Test

### Quick Test (5 minutes)

1. **Open Console** (React Native Debugger or browser console)

2. **Navigate to Words Tab**

    - Add words using "Blockchain Theme" template
    - Watch console for transaction logs
    - Verify words added

3. **Navigate to Play Tab**

    - Should see "No Active Game"
    - Console should show: `[GameContext] No active game found`

4. **Tap "Start New Game"**

    - Watch console for full flow
    - Should see transaction ID
    - Wait 5 seconds
    - GameScreen should load

5. **Make a Guess**

    - Type 5 letters (e.g., "STONE")
    - Press ENTER
    - Watch console
    - Letters should appear immediately
    - Wait 5 seconds
    - Grid should update

6. **Complete the Game**
    - Keep guessing
    - Watch for completion logs
    - Modal should appear
    - Word should be revealed
    - Colors should show

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Problem: No logs appear

**Solution:**

-   Make sure console is open
-   Check React Native Debugger is connected
-   Try `console.log("test")` to verify logging works

### Problem: Transaction fails

**Check console for:**

```
[useContract] Contract call failed: ...
Alert: "Transaction Failed: ..."
```

**Common causes:**

-   Insufficient STX balance
-   Wrong contract address
-   Network issues
-   Invalid parameters

### Problem: Game state doesn't update

**Check console for:**

```
[GameContext] Error loading active game: ...
```

**Solutions:**

-   Wait longer (increase timeout)
-   Clear cache: `apiCache.clearAll()`
-   Check transaction on explorer
-   Verify contract has words

### Problem: Tiles don't show colors

**This is expected!**

-   Colors only show when game completes
-   During play, tiles show as "filled" (gray with letters)
-   When you win/lose, all colors appear

## 📝 Pre-flight Checklist

Before testing, verify:

-   [ ] Wallet created and mnemonic saved
-   [ ] User registered with username
-   [ ] Contract address correct in config
-   [ ] Network set to testnet
-   [ ] STX balance > 0.001
-   [ ] Word pool has words (check Words tab)
-   [ ] Console is open and logging
-   [ ] React Native Debugger connected (if using)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

### Starting Game

-   ⏱️ Takes ~5 seconds
-   📱 Shows loading indicator
-   ✅ GameScreen loads with empty grid
-   🎮 Keyboard enabled

### Making Guesses

-   ⚡ Letters appear instantly (optimistic)
-   ⏱️ Confirmation takes ~5 seconds
-   📱 Shows submitted guess in grid
-   🔄 Can continue guessing

### Completing Game

-   🏁 After correct guess or 6 attempts
-   📥 Fetches answer from blockchain
-   🎨 All tiles show proper colors
-   🎉 Modal appears with results
-   📊 Stats update on blockchain

## 💡 Tips

1. **Be Patient**: Blockchain transactions take time
2. **Watch Console**: All steps are logged
3. **Check Alerts**: Success/error messages appear
4. **Wait for Confirmation**: Don't spam the keyboard
5. **First Game May Be Slow**: Subsequent games are faster (caching)
