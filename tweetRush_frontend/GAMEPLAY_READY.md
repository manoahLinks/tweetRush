## 🎮 How Gameplay Works

### Starting a Game

```
User → Tap "Start New Game"
     → Contract call: start-game()
     → Blockchain picks random word
     → Game starts with empty grid
     → Ready to play!
```

### Playing the Game

```
User → Type 5-letter word
     → Press ENTER
     → Optimistic update (letters appear instantly)
     → Contract call: submit-guess(word)
     → Wait ~4 seconds for confirmation
     → Grid updates with blockchain data
     → If not complete, continue playing
     → If complete, fetch answer and evaluate all guesses
     → Show colors and win/lose modal
```

### Tile Color Logic

**During Active Game:**

-   Guesses show as **FILLED** tiles (letters visible, no colors)
-   Maintains suspense!
-   Can still deduce info from what you've tried

**When Game Completes:**

-   Fetch actual word from blockchain
-   Evaluate ALL guesses locally
-   Tiles update to show:
    -   🟩 GREEN (correct position)
    -   🟨 YELLOW (wrong position)
    -   ⬜ GRAY (not in word)
-   Dramatic color reveal!
