# üß™ Test Gameplay - Debug Mode Enabled

I've added extensive logging to help us find the issue. Let's debug together!

## Step 1: Open the App with Console

```bash
cd /Users/0t41k1/Documents/tweetRush/tweetRush_frontend
npm start
```

Then press `w` to open in web browser (easier to see console logs).

## Step 2: Open Browser Console

-   Chrome: `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows)
-   Firefox: `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+K` (Windows)
-   Safari: `Cmd+Option+C` (Mac)

## Step 3: Complete Onboarding

1. Open the app
2. Complete wallet creation
3. Register with a username
4. You should see the main app

## Step 4: Navigate to Play Tab

Click on the "Play" tab

## Step 5: Check Console for Initial Logs

You should see logs like:

```
[GameContext] Checking for active game...
[GameContext] Has active game response: ...
[GameContext] Loading active game data...
```

**If you DON'T see these logs**, the GameContext isn't loading properly.

## Step 6: Click "Start New Game"

When you click the button, you should see:

```
=== START GAME BUTTON CLICKED ===
isConnected: true
address: ST...
hasActiveGame: false
Starting game...
Calling startGame()...
[GameContext] startGame() called
[GameContext] canPlay: true
[GameContext] hasActiveGame: false
[GameContext] Calling startNewGame()...
[useContract] startNewGame called
```

## What to Look For

### Scenario 1: Button Does Nothing

**Console shows:** Nothing
**Problem:** Click handler not attached or React not rendering
**Fix:** Check if PlayScreen is actually being rendered

### Scenario 2: "NOT CONNECTED"

**Console shows:** `NOT CONNECTED`
**Problem:** Wallet not initialized
**Fix:** Complete onboarding properly, check WalletContext

### Scenario 3: "Cannot play - not connected"

**Console shows:** `[GameContext] Cannot play - not connected`
**Problem:** `canPlay` is false
**Fix:** Check `isConnected` value in WalletContext

### Scenario 4: Transaction Error

**Console shows:** Error messages about transaction
**Possible causes:**

-   Contract not deployed at the address in config
-   No words in the word pool
-   Insufficient STX for fees
-   Network error

### Scenario 5: "No words available"

**Console shows:** Contract error `err-no-words-available`
**Problem:** Word pool is empty
**Fix:** Admin needs to add words first

## Step 7: Check Contract State

Add this to browser console:

```javascript
// Test if contract exists and has words
async function testContract() {
    try {
        const response = await fetch(
            "https://api.testnet.hiro.so/v2/contracts/call-read/ST264AMXKZA5Y4YVMDPA3CDGFGT7Q885W8R15FK7G/wordleRush/get-total-words",
            {
                method: "POST",
                headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    sender: "ST264AMXKZA5Y4YVMDPA3CDGFGT7Q885W8R15FK7G",
                    arguments: [],
                }),
            }
        );
        const data = await response.json();
        console.log("Contract response:", data);

        if (data.okay && data.result) {
            console.log("‚úÖ Contract exists!");
            const totalWords = parseInt(
                data.result.replace("(ok u", "").replace(")", "")
            );
            console.log(`Total words in pool: ${totalWords}`);

            if (totalWords === 0) {
                console.error("‚ùå NO WORDS IN POOL! Admin must add words.");
            } else {
                console.log(`‚úÖ ${totalWords} words available`);
            }
        } else {
            console.error("‚ùå Contract not found or error:", data);
        }
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("‚ùå Failed to check contract:", error);
    }
}

testContract();
```

## Step 8: Add Words (If Needed)

If the word pool is empty, you need to add words as admin:

1. Go to Admin tab
2. Use the "Add Words" function
3. Add words like: `HELLO`, `WORLD`, `STACKS`, `BLOCK`, `CHAIN`

Or use the console (if you're the admin):

```javascript
// Note: This requires you to be logged in as the contract owner
// The address in contract-config.ts must match your wallet address
```

## Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Everything is Static"

**Check List:**

1. ‚úÖ Open browser console and look for errors
2. ‚úÖ Click "Start New Game" and watch console
3. ‚úÖ Verify wallet is connected (check address in console)
4. ‚úÖ Test if contract exists (run testContract() above)
5. ‚úÖ Check if words are in pool
6. ‚úÖ Verify you have STX for transaction fees (~0.001 STX)

### Issue: Contract Not Deployed

**Symptoms:**

-   API calls return 404 or "contract not found"
-   Console shows network errors

**Fix:**

1. Deploy the contract from `tweetRush_contract/`
2. Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `lib/contract-config.ts`
3. Update `CONTRACT_NAME` if different

### Issue: No Words in Pool

**Symptoms:**

-   Transaction returns `err-no-words-available`
-   `get-total-words` returns 0

**Fix:**

1. Ensure you're the contract owner (wallet address matches `contract-owner`)
2. Use Admin screen to add words
3. Or deploy a new contract with words pre-added

### Issue: Wallet Not Connected

**Symptoms:**

-   `isConnected: false` in console
-   No address shown
-   "Wallet Required" alert

**Fix:**

1. Complete onboarding flow
2. Check WalletContext is providing wallet/address
3. Verify mnemonic is stored in AsyncStorage

## Step 9: Share Console Logs

If it's still not working, please share:

1. Full console output when clicking "Start New Game"
2. Any error messages (in red)
3. Result of `testContract()` function

This will help me identify the exact issue!

## Quick Sanity Check

Run this in browser console after opening the app:

```javascript
console.log("=== SANITY CHECK ===");
console.log("React loaded:", typeof React !== "undefined");
console.log("Current URL:", window.location.href);
console.log("Local storage:", localStorage);
```

Let's find the real issue together! The logs will tell us exactly what's happening (or not happening).
